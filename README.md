Other popular choices include **Biryani**, **Continental**, **Desserts**, **Cafe**, **Beverages**, and **Italian**.

### 2. Online Ordering vs. Booking Facilities
- A majority of restaurants offer **online ordering**, highlighting its importance to consumers. However, there is a **notable lack** of booking facilities in many restaurants, despite a growing trend in online ordering.

### 3. Location-Specific Trends
- Certain locations such as **Koramangala 5th Block**, **Whitefield**, and **Indiranagar** exhibit high dining activity, while others like **Banashankari** and **Electronic City** show lower activity. Popular areas are characterized by a high number of restaurants and a significant number of votes, indicating high consumer engagement.

### 4. Rating Patterns by Location
- Locations such as **Banashankari** and **Church Street** have higher median ratings, reflecting better restaurant quality. In contrast, areas like **Rajajinagar** and **New BEL Road** exhibit lower median ratings, suggesting potential areas for improvement.

### 5. Cost and Rating Analysis
- There is no strong correlation between **restaurant cost** and **rating**. Affordable restaurants tend to have a wide range of ratings, while higher-cost restaurants generally maintain decent ratings but are fewer in number.

### 6. Impact of Booking Facilities on Ratings
- Restaurants offering **table booking** facilities tend to have higher and more consistent ratings compared to those that do not, suggesting that the convenience of booking may contribute to better customer satisfaction.

### 7. Votes and Popularity
- Locations with high **votes**, such as **Koramangala 5th Block** and **Whitefield**, are popular dining spots with substantial consumer reviews. Conversely, areas with low votes, like **Shanti Nagar** and **St. Marks Road**, show less dining activity, indicating potential opportunities for new restaurant ventures.

### 8. Variability in Ratings Across Restaurant Types
- **Pubs and bars** have the highest median ratings, followed by **drinks & nightlife** venues. **Delivery restaurants** have the lowest median rating and show more variability, highlighting different customer satisfaction levels across restaurant types.

### 9. Optimal Areas for New Restaurants
- Based on location and rating trends, areas with a high density of dining activity and better ratings such as **Koramangala** and **Whitefield** are ideal for establishing new restaurants. Conversely, less frequented areas with potential growth, like **Electronic City**, could benefit from introducing new dining options.

### 10. Potential Market for Booking Services
- Given the high number of non-booking venues in popular areas, there is an opportunity to increase the availability of table booking services to cater to customer demand and enhance the dining experience.
